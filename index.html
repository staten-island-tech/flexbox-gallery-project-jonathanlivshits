            <div class="sub-image" id="sub-image-1"></div>
            <p class="sub-description">Alex loves sports and hanging out at the beach. He is quite arrogant and brags to everyone that he is going to be a professional athlete. Is his cockiness just a facade to mask his crushing self-doubt? Is he using his sports dream to fill the void left by the disappearance of his parents? Or is he just a brazen youth trying to 'look cool?</p>

            <p class="sub-description">I'd like to talk about the famous Adventurer's Guild near Pelican Town. The guild leader, Marlon, has a nice rewards program for anyone brave enough to slay monsters in the local caves. Adventurers will receive powerful items in exchange for slaying large quantities of monsters.</p>

            <p class="sub-description">Pam and Clint come into the saloon almost every night. I'd probably go out of business if they stopped coming. So make sure you don't drive them away!</p>

            <div class="sub-image" id="sub-image-4"></div>
            <p class="sub-description">Being wealthy and popular throughout high school has made Haley a little conceited and self-centered. She has a tendency to judge people for superficial reasons. But is it too late for her to discover a deeper meaning to life? Is there a fun, open-minded young woman hidden within that candy-coated shell?</p>

            <div class="sub-image" id="sub-image-5"></div>
            <p class="sub-description">Harvey is the town doctor. He’s a little old for a bachelor, but he has a kind heart and a respected position in the community. He lives in a small apartment above the medical clinic, but spends most of his time working. You can sense a sadness about him, as if there’s something he’s not telling you…</p>

            <p class="sub-description">...Have you encountered others like me, in the mines? I'm sorry if they were hostile towards you. You see, we've learned to fear humans... there have been too many... unpleasant encounters.</p>

            <div class="sub-image" id="sub-image-7"></div>
            <p class="sub-description">Leah lives alone in a small cabin just outside of town. She loves to spend time outside, foraging for a wild meal or simply enjoying the gifts of the season. She’s a talented artist with a large portfolio of work… yet she’s too nervous to display it to the public. Maybe you can give her a little confidence boost?</p>

            <p class="sub-description">Growing up with a carpenter and a scientist for parents, Maru acquired a passion for creating gadgets at a young age. When she isn’t in her room, fiddling with tools and machinery, she sometimes does odd jobs at the local clinic.</p>

            <p class="sub-description">My parents were bewildered when I told them I wanted to be a carpenter. They were pretty old-fashioned.</p>
